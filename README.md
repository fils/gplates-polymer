## Background
This component makes a call to the [gplates service](http://gplates.gps.caltech.edu:8080/doc/).  [Gplates](http://www.gplates.org) is a tool for making 
visualizations of plate tectonic movement.  One can view a model of what the earth looked like millions of years ago.  For modern researchers it provides an 
method to see where a sample (like a fossil) found today would have been located when it existed.   

This web component allows a person to provide a set of latitude and longitude points, an age in millions of years and see where they would have been located and what
the plates would have looked like.
